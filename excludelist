# This file lists libraries that we will assume to be present on the host system and hence
# should NOT be bundled inside AppImages. This is a working document; expect it to change
# over time. File format: one filename per line. Each entry should have a justification comment.

# See the useful tool at https://abi-laboratory.pro/index.php?view=navigator&symbol=hb_buffer_set_cluster_level#result
# to investigate issues with missing symbols.
