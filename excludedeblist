# The files contained in these debian packages and their dependencies 
# are assumed to be present in the base system (distribution)
# in a "recent enough" version (or the end user has to install
# missing ones from this manually using the distribution's
# package manager if required). Note that this only works if
# the ingredients to the AppImage do not require newer versions
# of these packages than what can safely be assumed to be part
# of the base system. This is why we recommend oldstable
# ingredients for AppImages
